/**
 * @file saf_externals.h
 * @brief Include header for SAF externals
 *
 * @note Including this header is optional and only needed if you wish to have
 *       access to these external libraries in your own project.
 * @note More information can be found in the docs folder regarding where to
 *       find and how to link dependencies
 * @warning Using ATLAS (SAF_USE_ATLAS) as the performance library is not
 *          recommended, since some LAPACK routines are not implemented by the
 *          library! However, if you don't mind losing some SAF functionality
 *          (namely: certain veclib utility functions), then it may still be a
 *          good choice for your particular project.
 *
 * ## Required Dependencies
 *   A performance library comprising CBLAS and LAPACK routines is required by
 *   SAF. Add one of the following FLAGS to your project's preprocessor
 *   definitions in order to enable one of these suitable performance libraries,
 *   (which must be correctly linked when building SAF):
 *   - SAF_USE_INTEL_MKL_LP64:
 *       to enable Intel's Math Kernel Library with the Fortran LAPACK interface
 *   - SAF_USE_INTEL_MKL_ILP64
 *       same as SAF_USE_INTEL_MKL except using int64 and LAPACKE interface
 *   - SAF_USE_OPENBLAS_WITH_LAPACKE:
 *       to enable OpenBLAS with the LAPACKE interface
 *   - SAF_USE_APPLE_ACCELERATE:
 *       to enable the Accelerate framework with the Fortran LAPACK interface
 *   - SAF_USE_ATLAS:
 *       to enable ATLAS BLAS routines and ATLAS's CLAPACK interface
 *
 * ## Optional dependencies
 *   If the optional saf_sofa_reader module is enabled and SAF_ENABLE_NETCDF is
 *   defined, then the netcdf library must also be linked along with saf.
 *
 *   Intel IPP may be optionally employed with the flag: SAF_USE_INTEL_IPP
 *
 *   FFTW may be optionally employed with the flag: SAF_USE_FFTW
 *
 *   SIMD intrinsics utilisation may be enabled with: SAF_ENABLE_SIMD
 *    - SSE/SSE2/SSE3 intrinsics are used by default
 *    - AVX/AVX2 intrinsics are enabled with compiler flag: -mavx2
 *    - AVX-512  intrinsics are enabled with compiler flag: -mavx512f
 *   (Note that intrinsics require a CPU that supports them)

 * The built-in saf_sofa_open() SOFA file reader has two implementations:

 *      (BSD-3-Clause license), which depends on only zlib (which is included
 *      in framework/resources/zlib). The downsides of this option, is that zlib
 *      has file size limits for each chunk (<4GB) and it is quite slow at
 *      decompressing large files.
 *    - If SAF_ENABLE_NETCDF is defined, then an alternative SOFA reader may be
 *      used. This version requires netcdf to be linked to SAF, along with its
 *      dependencies. The netcdf loader gets around the file size limits of
 *      the libmysofa loader and is also approximately 3 times faster.
 *      Therefore, if you intend to load many large SOFA files
 *      (especially microphone arrays or Ambisonic IRs), then this alternative
 *      SOFA reader is either required (to get around the file size limit) or
 *      may be preferred due to the shorter loading times. The downsides of
 *      using the netcdf option is that it is NOT thread-safe! and requires
 *      these additional external libraries to be linked to SAF.
 *
 * Note that the "mysofa" interface, e.g. mysofa_load(), may also be called
 * directly, rather than using saf_sofa_open().
